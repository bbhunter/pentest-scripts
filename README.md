## Informational

I made these scripts for my needs and tried to understand a little bit of how some bug hunters work and put some of those steps in a logical order for me. </br>
</br>
Until I consider this work finished, I'll continue to study and saw how some people work and put it in features within collector script. :D </br>
</br>
Here in this README.md I put just the list of main scripts and a little bit of information about your functionality. </br>
</br>
Any other secondary scripts in this repository will have it's description in the script header.
