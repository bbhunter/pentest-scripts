## Informational

I made these scripts for my needs and tried to understand a little bit of how some bug hunters work and put some of those steps in a logical order for me. </br>
</br>
Until I consider this work finished, I'll continue to study and saw how some people work and put it in features within collector script. :D </br>
</br>
Here in this README.md I put just the list of main scripts and a little bit of information about your functionality. </br>
</br>
Any other secondary scripts in this repository will have it's description in the script header.

## Main scripts

 - **collector**: was moved to your own [repository](https://github.com/skateforever/collector), it can be used in recon directory and your funcionality is subdomain and web data discovery;
 - **g4sp4rz1nh0**: was moved to your own [repository](https://github.com/skateforever/g4sp4rz1nh0), it's a modified version of splitter to create a infraestructure to anonymization during pentest to avoid WAF/Firewall block to our IP. If you need to understand how it's works, you need to read from the [original repository](https://github.com/renergr1nch/splitter);
 - **get-tools**: can be find in useful directory and prepare the operation system to collector and get other tools to help in pentest;
 - **seek-leak**: tool to search for leaks on onion network [deprecated]. I need time and inspiration to evolve the tool and in the future throw it into its own repository.

**Feel free to copy, use and build on it.**

**Warning:** The code of all scripts find here was originally created for personal use, it generates a substantial amount of traffic, please use with caution.
